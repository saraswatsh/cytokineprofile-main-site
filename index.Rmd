## Why Cytokine Profiling?

Cytokine profiling serves as an invaluable tool in biomedical research and diagnostics, shedding light on immune responses and disease mechanisms through the analysis of cytokine interactions. Existing tools lack features specifically tailored to the complexities of cytokine data.

**CytokineProfile** fills this gap by providing a comprehensive pipeline—from data import and quality control to advanced machine-learning classification and publication-ready visualizations.
